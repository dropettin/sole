So like I've said in previous posts, astral projection is a matter of perspective switching like tuning into a radio; this is broken down into two very important stages that facilitate a successful projection for anyone who desires it: The Relaxation Stage and The Separation Stage. Let's seriously understand this because once you do you'll be able to custom fit your own method that will always work for you regardless of time, area, positioning, crystals, binaurual beats, mudras, incense, etc. Once you master the foundations of how this detachment of consciousness from the physical body actually works on a personal level it won't take long for it to click either because of this guide. By focusing on the two stages individually (being in the present moment), you can project after reading this post. I posted this earlier today but deleted it because I didn't like the title

The Relaxation Stage:

Not worrying about the separation stage yet, you need to find a comfortable spot to separate which obviously is something that is specific to you. A lot of guides like to emphasize being in a quiet place but that doesn't actually matter, it's only advised because its assumedly easier with no noise (which is a unrealistic situation anyways if you live in a noisy home) but again it won't hinder your progress if you don't worry about it, same with body position. I sleep in the same room as my younger brother who plays Fortnite and watches alot of shows while I mediate laying on my back and I can still reach the mind awake body asleep state as easily as I could on the downstairs couch sitting up cross legged; caring about the noise creates a mental block that prevents you from separating. I actually use the sounds I hear to make it easier, I imagine what I'm hearing which puts me in a trance faster as if it was white noise or a binaural beat. Adapt and overcome.

Another thing you hear is the emphasis on the breath which has merit, it's very important because the process of astral projecting is just relaxing the body so that you can shift your awareness from the physical (what your body feels like, the noises around you, the room temperature) to the non-physical and holding that focus until you pop out your body (by visualizations, looking at the darkness in your closed eyelids, other separation techniques). The focusing of the breath accomplishes both tasks of relaxing the body while keeping you aware enough to reach the hypnagogic state without falling asleep, but the problem appears when you just breathe normally because it gets boring. So what should be done? Adopt a breathing pattern.

It gives you something to focus on long enough to fully relax the body, reaching the mind awake body asleep/void state and it works fast enough to prevent you from falling asleep too quickly. HOW you’re breathing is more important than what breathing pattern you use. The best way to explain it is feeling the air coming from your stomach when you inhale then exhale to what feels comfortable. Repeat this way of breathing while simultaneously keeping your tongue pressed to the roof of your mouth near the teeth and you’ll get to point to where you completely lose awareness of your body. Continue this breathing even further, more than you think would be necessary. After hundreds of failed attempts you learn to not take chances because you decided to get lazy. If you don’t experience the things I describe in the hypnagogic state, you need to continue focusing on the breathing pattern until you do and it will happen so trust me, been doing this for a while and yes you’ll fall asleep on some attempts but so what? Every time you practice you get better at staying awake so it’s a win-win.

What I Personally Do For The Relaxation Stage:

Keep my tongue pressed to the roof of my mouth near the teeth

Inhale from the stomach for 4 seconds through nose, Hold my breath for 7 seconds, then Exhale through the mouth for 8 seconds making a ‘whoosh’ sound (with tongue at same position)

I repeat this over and over not worrying about how many times I do it. Whenever I lose focus, I ask “How do I feel right now?” It pushes me deeper as I continue back to the breathing pattern.

The Separation Stage:

After a few minutes of doing this breathing (the first time for me took 40 minutes but it didn’t feel like it, then on the second try I got it down to 15 minutes) you will feel different. You won’t be thinking about your body and when you do you’ll realize you’ve felt weightless for some time. You might see some irregular shapes form from the darkness behind your eyelids. You’ll lose sense of time. Hell you’ll even realize you stopped doing the breathing pattern and have to keep reminding yourself because you’re so lost in the random thoughts and imagery. You are in the hypnagogic state, the state required for bridging your awareness from walking around in the physical to flying in the astral. You get to this state instantly throughout the day when you daydream only now you’ve consciously decided to walk on this bridge. We can now continue into the last and easiest stage since you are already 98% done; The Separation Stage.

What you did just now leading up to this was priming the physical body for projecting; you've distracted yourself so much with the breathing pattern that you no longer are focused on the physical, you are now focused on the non-physical. All you have to do in the separation stage is well...separate. Get up, imagine climbing a rope up, imagine yourself floating up, try to remember a certain location with as much detail possible, etc. There are infinite possibilities for how you leave your body (see it as a dense vehicle piloted by your consciousness) so do what feels easy. In this state of awareness, the ego is silenced so any thought you make to separate will successfully facilitate a projection without doubt inhibiting progress so don't stress about hypothetical situations, the future doesn't exist yet remember so focus on the present moment; the relaxation stage then moving to the separation stage. This is what is meant by "Just let go maaaann"

What I Personally Do For The Separation Stage:

Now in the hypnagogic state, I do different things each time based on what feels easiest at the moment. The first time I purposely reached this state, I intuitively thought "I wanna see through my eyelids" and almost instantly my vision shifted from the darkness behind my eyelids to being able to clearly see the blue light of my alarm clock reflecting off the slanted ceiling above where my physical eyes would be looking at while at the same time physically feeling my shut eyelids. Another day I just sat up after reaching the hypagogic state again, techniques always say "feel the sensation of getting up" or some other nonsense but when you actually reach this state there's nothing to "think" about; I had the intention of getting up and I did, it was as realistic as waking life and that's when the fun begins :smile:

That’s literally it; relaxing with breathing pattern, reaching the hypnagogic state, then separating. It’s simple which is why the ancients could do it but simplicity can easily lead to complexity when seen through the lens of overthought. Relax and practice and you’ll do great, see you later astralnauts.<br><br>CDT Consciousness Deepening Technique<br><br>
This is one of the Major techniques I developed early that works insanely well. I had it posted before and will post again now. Below is the original procedure:

There is a borderline which separates consciousness and unconsciousness, or awake and asleep. The majority of people fall asleep between low alpha or high theta. Consciousness begins to grow dimmer as it nears the borderline and once it crosses over, it becomes unconsciousness.

To develop the ability for conscious out of body travel, the borderline must recede far enough to allow consciousness in theta and delta. This can be accomplished by practicing certain meditative exercises or relaxation techniques. Through experimentation I have developed a technique which does precisely this. I call this technique C.D.T., short for consciousness deepening technique.

Once the borderline is extended, consciousness will be present until the borderline is crossed. If the borderline has been extended to theta, then consciousness will be present in beta, alpha and theta. On falling asleep or on waking up, consciousness will be present in theta. This will give you the opportunity to experiment on out of body travel various times during sleep.

Different-Types-of-Brain-Waves

Here then is the technique:

Sit down comfortably with head not leaning on anything. Take a couple of deep breaths and then let the breathing resume its normal rhythm. Now, mentally search for the sensation of sleep or try to replicate it. It’s the same sensation of being sleepy. Gently hold it in your awareness. Next, begin counting backwards from fifty to one(some times I also gently concentrate on a chakra while doing the countdown). You will begin to feel sleepy. The sleepiness will begin to increase and you will begin your descent into sleep. The sleep sensation or signal, as I prefer to call it, will lead you through all the stages of sleep. As you begin to cross the borderline your head will begin to fall. The sensation of your head falling will momentarily arouse your consciousness. Remain calm, raise your head, continue to hold on to the sleep signal and restart the countdown from fifty. You will continue your descent into sleep and every time you cross the borderline your head will fall and you will become conscious again. Continue doing this as long as possible. This cycle of crossing the borderline, your head falling and bringing consciousness back is actually pushing the awake/asleep borderline back toward deeper levels of sleep. This means that if before you would fall asleep while entering alpha, now you will remain awake all the way into theta and even delta. You will know your progress by the subjective guide posts of each level of brain activity. You will know when you have entered alpha by the relaxed sensations. Theta by the dreamlike hallucinations and delta by the disappearance of dream images and sense of release from gravity.

Many times while practicing you may simply fall asleep or get so sleepy you have to lie down. This is normal and is a good sign that you have found the sleep signal. Do not be discouraged if this happens. It does take a lot of practice to remain awake where normally you would be asleep.
<br><br>I do a fifty to one backwards count. I will count each number after the exhale. Exhale 50, exhale 49, exhale 48 and so on. This is just to settle my mind a bit. The real crucial part comes next and sometimes I just go directly to this part and skip the countdown. I place my attention to a spot about two to three inches behind the middle of both my eyes. There is no thinking involved at all. I do not count, think or perform any other mental activity except placing my attention on this spot. If any thoughts pop up, I simply refocus my attention on The Spot. After some time (can be seconds or minutes) , it feels like a floodgate opens at The Spot and floods my body with a sensation of being submerged under water. Sometimes the sensations come in spurts before taking complete hold, like a short circuit. Once I am submerged in this liquid light state, I am multidimensional. Many things can happen at this point. For example, a flood of random images can fill my awareness, or I can focus my attention on any place or time and instantly see it before me, or I can simply float up and away from my physical in my non-physical body. I would see everything that I normally see when in my physical form while I am vibrating at the Etheric frequency. Usually at this point I increase my frequency so that I may dial into a higher frequency realm. This is usually where a lot  of the action takes place.


Ok, I know there will be a lot of questions concerning this technique that I call The Spot. The Spot goes by many names like the Pineal Gland or The Third Eye. For me it is very natural now but I realize others may not see it as natural as I do. Please ask me anything and I will try to answer all of your questions.
