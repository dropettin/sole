A wood form provides the key to knowing everything that is made of wood, as all forms are mere names, simple puns; the real stuff they are made of is wood and nothing else.<!--<br>
A form of gold reveals the nature of all forms of the same metal, as all forms are mere names, mere puns; the real stuff they are made of is gold and nothing else.<br>
One form of iron reveals the nature of all forms of iron, as all forms are mere names, mere puns; the real stuff they are made of is iron and nothing else.<br>
In this way, friend, what I have explained to you in the words must be understood: You are That.<br>
<br><br>
That which is not expressed in words, but by which each word is pronounced;<br>
That which is not thought in the mind, but by which the mind thinks;<br>
That which is not perceived with the eye, but through which the eye receives light;<br>
That which is not heard with the ear, but through which the ear hears;<br>
That which is not breathed in the breath of life, but through which life itself is preserved;<br>
It is the word of the words, the mind of the minds, the eye of the eyes, the ear of the ears, the breath of the breaths.<br>
This is your Self, that emanates this universe of ideas and of all thought, that is within all; everything else but This is perishable.<br>
<br>



<br>
Putting a piece of salt in the water, it merges with this from which it comes, and you will never be able to grab it again: every drop of water you can touch is salt.<br> 
As the sun that illuminates everything has in no way anything to do with the numerous evils that the eye can perceive, so the universal inner Self, eternal one, has no relation to the joys and sorrows of the world, because it transcends them.<br>
So indeed, my dear, is this great, eternal, enlightened Being, all thought.<br>
The universe comes from this, it vanishes in this, and having thus vanished there is no longer any diversity in It.<br>
I look with the same eye at a poisonous snake and a garland of flowers, a powerful enemy or a dear friend, an expensive jewel or a pile of earth, an expanse of flowers or a stone slab, a group of beautiful women or a bundle of useless twigs.<br>

When the mind is filled with the idea of nectar, the whole universe is filled with nectar; the earth is covered with leather for the one who has put his foot in the shoe.<br>

As the statue pre-exists in the wood, and a statue also exists in each part of that statue and so on ad infinitum; so this gigantic statue - the cosmos - exists in the One.<br>

Only where there is duality can one see the other, smell the other, hear the other, talk to another, think of another, know another.<br> 
But when everything is a Self, what should one smell and with what? What to see and with what? What to hear and with what? What to talk about and with whom? What to think and with what? What to know and with what? Indeed for by what could He who knows all be known? From what could it be the Knower known?<br>
<br>
The one who knows It overcomes death and enters Immortality becoming the <b>Silent one</b>.
